  <summary><h3>My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  <p>
  My journey began as a hobby, which quickly turned into a passion for coding. I started by teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript daily. After a year of self-teaching, I decided to formalize my education by enrolling in Hack Reactor's 19-week advanced software engineering bootcamp. This intensive program reinforced my skills and provided me with the opportunity to work on real-world projects alongside other skilled developers.

As a Software Engineer, my ultimate goal is to create software that not only meets but exceeds user expectations. I measure success by the positive impact my work has on end-users and clients. By diligently understanding user needs and incorporating feedback, I consistently deliver solutions that delight and enhance the overall user experience.
